This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message might vaguely mention issues with the Android build system or Gradle, but doesn't pinpoint the exact cause. This is often due to an incompatibility between the Expo SDK version, the Android build tools, or Gradle version.

Example of cryptic error message:
```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
...
...
Caused by: org.gradle.internal.exceptions.LocationAwareException: Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'.
...
```
