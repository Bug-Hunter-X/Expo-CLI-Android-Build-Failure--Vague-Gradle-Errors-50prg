# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Vague Gradle Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-diagnose, error encountered when building Android apps using Expo CLI. The error manifests as a vague Gradle failure during the `expo prebuild` process, providing little information to pinpoint the root cause. This is frequently caused by version mismatches between Expo SDK, Android build tools, or the Gradle version itself.

## Reproducing the Bug

(Instructions on how to reproduce the bug, specifying the Expo SDK version, and Android build tools version used)

## Solution

The solution typically involves carefully checking and updating the following:

1. **Expo SDK Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible and up-to-date Expo SDK version. Check the Expo documentation for the latest releases and any known compatibility issues.
2. **Android Build Tools:** Update the Android build tools to the latest stable version. This might involve modifying your `android/build.gradle` file.
3. **Gradle Version:** Check and update the Gradle version specified in your `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file.  Choose a Gradle version known to be compatible with your Expo SDK and Android build tools.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Before attempting any version updates, perform a clean build of your project: `expo prebuild --clean` followed by a fresh build: `expo prebuild`. This can often resolve transient issues.
5. **Check Dependencies:** Examine your package.json to identify any dependencies that may be conflicting with Expo's requirements.

By systematically addressing these potential causes, you should be able to pinpoint and resolve the vague Gradle build failure during Expo's Android build process.
